# Format Specifications

## UPDATE:
I have now posted these specifications on the [TWHL wiki](https://twhl.info/wiki/page/category%3AFormat_Specifications) and I highly recommend visiting these pages instead. They are more up-to-date and have lots of useful information added to them by people far more knowledgable than I.

Here I document the various formats used in the Map2Prop project.

A semi-pseudo C typedef struct syntax is used in these pages for describing structure definitions.

For data type notation check the table on [this page](datatypes).
